# Face Detector 👤📸

A simple and efficient **Face Detection** project that detects human faces in images and real-time video streams using computer vision techniques. This project is suitable for beginners as well as developers exploring computer vision applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detects human faces accurately  
- Supports image and real-time detection  
- Fast and lightweight performance  
- Easy to understand and extend  
- Works under different lighting conditions  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Haar Cascade / DNN  
- NumPy  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The system processes images or video frames by converting them to grayscale and applying a pre-trained face detection model. The model scans the frame at multiple scales to locate faces and highlights them with bounding boxes.
